This is a project intended to simplify the requirement-gathering phase of SDLC, by parsing the initial requirement document, which states the basic goals of the project. 
The tool identifies and classifies terms related to the various domains of non-functional requirements, such as performance, connectivity, security, database, and so on. 

It uses the MAUI library for extracting term using a given dictionary, and uses WEKA for classifying them into their respective domains.
