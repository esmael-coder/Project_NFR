This is a project intended to simplify the requirement-gathering phase of SDLC, by parsing the initial requirement document, which states the basic goals of the project. 
The tool identifies terms related to the various types of non-functional requirements, such as performance, connectivity, security, and so on. 

It uses the MAUI library for extracting term using a given dictionary, and uses WEKA for classifying them into their respective domains.
